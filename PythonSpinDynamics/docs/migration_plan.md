# MATLAB-to-Python Migration Status and Plan

## Reference Policy

- Keep `SpinDynamicsUpdated/Version_2/code` as the active MATLAB reference.
- Keep `SpinDynamicsUpdated/Version_1` and `SpinDynamics` as legacy references.
- Do not move or rewrite MATLAB files as part of the Python port.

## Completed Phase 1: Baseline and Fixtures

- Small reference outputs are stored under `validation/fixtures`.
- Fixture generation is scripted in `validation/octave/generate_basic_fixtures.m`.
- The same script can be run from MATLAB or Octave.
- MATLAB-generated fixtures are used for matched-probe cases that require
  optimization toolbox behavior not available in a stock Octave install.
- The current Python test suite contains 61 checks against fixtures, public
  workflow result shapes, compatibility helpers, and example smoke paths.

## Completed Phase 2: Low-Level Numerical Helpers

- Free-precession matrix elements and RF pulse matrix elements are available in
  `spin_dynamics.core.kernels` and `spin_dynamics.core.rotations`.
- Effective rotation-axis helpers from `calc_rot` are available in
  `spin_dynamics.core.rotations`.
- Echo and FID time-domain conversion helpers are available in
  `spin_dynamics.core.echo`.

These functions remain the best first place to debug numerical drift because
their inputs and outputs are small, array-based, and close to NumPy's strengths.

## Completed Phase 3: Parameter and Sequence API

- MATLAB `sp`, `pp`, and `params` structures are represented by Python
  dataclasses.
- Validated constructors include:
  - `set_params_ideal`
  - `set_params_ideal_fid`
  - `set_params_tuned_orig`
  - `set_params_untuned_orig`
  - `set_params_matched_orig`
- Units remain explicit in the API and docs: ideal "bare" spin-dynamics helpers
  use normalized `w1` time, while probe helpers mirror MATLAB's absolute-time
  circuit conventions where applicable.

## Completed Phase 4: Ideal Workflows

- The ideal CPMG asymptotic path is ported and validated:
  `set_params_ideal` -> `calc_masy_ideal` -> `calc_time_domain_echo`.
- The ideal FID path is ported and validated:
  `set_params_ideal_FID` -> `simFID_ideal`.
- Public examples and workflow documentation are available under
  `examples/` and `docs/python_api/`.

## Completed Phase 5: Core Arbitrary-Pulse Kernel

- `sim_spin_dynamics_arb10.m` has a clear NumPy implementation.
- MATLAB coherence ordering is preserved and documented as `M0`, `M-`, `M+`.
- Precomputed pulse rotation matrix semantics are retained before any optimized
  backend is introduced.
- `sim_spin_dynamics_arb10_chunked` can split large isochromat grids into
  contiguous chunks and evaluate them across a thread pool while preserving the
  serial kernel's numerical result.
- The legacy-compatible `sim_spin_dynamics_arb7` path used by ideal FID is also
  available.

## Completed Phase 6: Original/Reference Probe CPMG Models

- Tuned, untuned, and matched original/reference CPMG paths are ported.
- Public runners are available:
  - `run_tuned_cpmg`
  - `run_untuned_cpmg`
  - `run_matched_cpmg`
- Lower-level probe modules expose transmit response, receive filtering,
  effective-axis helpers, received spectra, asymptotic spectra, and SNR where
  the MATLAB path provides it.
- The matched-probe port uses a NumPy-only Newton solve and fixed-step RK4 probe
  response to avoid adding SciPy as a required dependency. It is validated
  against MATLAB fixtures with practical tolerances appropriate for the
  independent solver.

## Started Phase 7: Relaxation, Acquisition Variants, and Sweeps

- `calc_macq_ideal_probe_relax4` is ported for assembled ideal-probe arbitrary
  sequences with relaxation during free-precession intervals.
- `calc_macq_tuned_probe_relax4` and `calc_macq_matched_probe_relax4` are
  ported and fixture-validated. `calc_macq_untuned_probe_relax4` is available
  as a Python analogue using the same receiver-map contract.
- `run_ideal_cpmg_train` provides a public finite ideal CPMG acquisition
  workflow returning acquired spectra, direct-summed echoes, and echo integrals.
- `run_tuned_cpmg_train`, `run_untuned_cpmg_train`, and
  `run_matched_cpmg_train` provide public finite probe CPMG trains with probe
  pulse shaping, receiver filtering, relaxation, direct-summed echoes, and echo
  integrals.
- `run_ideal_cpmg_ir_train`, `run_tuned_cpmg_ir_train`,
  `run_untuned_cpmg_ir_train`, and `run_matched_cpmg_ir_train` extend finite
  CPMG trains into inversion-recovery workflows over `tauvect`, following the
  assembly pattern in `Sim_CPMG_IR/sim_cpmg_ir_matched_probe_relax4.m`.
- Finite train workflows now estimate isochromat-grid rephasing time, warn or
  raise when the grid is too coarse, optionally refine `numpts` before building
  pulse matrices, and pass long isochromat vectors through the chunked backend
  with `num_workers`.
- `run_tuned_q_sweep`, `run_matched_q_sweep`, `run_tuned_mistuning_sweep`, and
  `run_matched_mistuning_sweep` port the plotting-oriented MATLAB Q and
  mistuning scripts into array-returning workflow APIs.
- `run_tuned_finite_q_sweep`, `run_untuned_finite_q_sweep`,
  `run_matched_finite_q_sweep`, and the corresponding finite mistuning sweeps
  are Python-native wrappers around the relaxation-aware finite train runners.
  They support `auto_refine_grid`, sweep-point parallelism, and chunked
  isochromat propagation.
- `run_matched_z_magnetization_q_sweep` ports the matched-probe z-magnetization
  Q sweep from `z_mag/z_Mag_Q.m`.
- `run_ideal_time_varying_cpmg_final` and
  `run_ideal_time_varying_amplitude_sweep` port the ideal time-varying-field
  final-echo workflow from `time_varying_field/sim_cpmg_ideal_tv_final.m` and
  its comparison scripts into array-returning APIs.
- `run_tuned_time_varying_cpmg_final`, `run_untuned_time_varying_cpmg_final`,
  and `run_matched_time_varying_cpmg_final` extend the same final-echo
  assembly to probe-shaped refocusing pulses and receiver transfer functions,
  with matching amplitude-sweep wrappers.
- `examples/probe_parameter_sweeps.py` provides a compact non-plot smoke path
  for the sweep APIs.
- `examples/ideal_time_varying_cpmg.py` provides a compact non-plot smoke path
  for ideal time-varying-field amplitude sweeps.
- `examples/matched_cpmg_ir_train.py` provides a compact non-plot smoke path
  for CPMG-IR echo-integral arrays.
- `examples/finite_probe_train_sweeps.py` provides a compact non-plot smoke
  path for finite-train Q and mistuning sweep arrays.
- Keep workflow-level APIs returning small typed result containers, following
  `CPMGResult`.

## Started Phase 8: Diffusion, Imaging, and Optimization

- `sim_spin_dynamics_arb10_diffusion` adds the diffusion free-precession
  attenuation term to the `arb10` kernel shape while preserving precomputed RF
  matrices and avoiding the older acquisition-window convolution.
- `calc_macq_matched_probe_relax_diffusion`,
  `run_matched_diffusion_cpmg`, and `run_matched_diffusion_q_sweep` provide the
  first compact matched-probe diffusion CPMG workflows, following
  `DIffusion_Example/Diff_Echo_Q.m` and
  `Sim_Diffusion/sim_dif_matched_CPMG_noRx.m`.
- Keep broad diffusion sweeps and Q>2000 cases behind additional solver
  validation, because the current NumPy matched-probe transient solver can
  become stiff for very high Q values.
- `run_ideal_phase_encoded_cpmg_imaging`,
  `run_tuned_phase_encoded_cpmg_imaging`, and
  `run_matched_phase_encoded_cpmg_imaging` port the compact phase-encoded CPMG
  imaging workflows from
  `Imaging_demo/imaging_example_ideal.m` and `Sim_CPMG/*_probe_img.m` into
  array-returning APIs.
- Tuned imaging preserves the MATLAB raw-current k-space convention by default
  and also exposes a receive-weighted mode that applies the tuned receiver
  transfer function and `b1_rx_map`.
- Ideal T1-prepared phase-encoded imaging adds an inversion-recovery
  preparation before phase encoding and CPMG, with post-processing helpers for
  selected-echo, echo-summed, fitted-rho, and fitted-T2 image formation.
- Compact MATLAB-generated k-space fixtures validate the ideal, tuned, and
  matched CPMG imaging workflows end to end.
- `examples/plot_ideal_imaging.py` plots the flower phantom, CPMG k-space, and
  reconstructed image for ideal, tuned, or matched probe models.
- `spin_dynamics.pulses` provides fixture-validated JMR rectangular pulse
  responses for tuned, untuned, and matched probes, phase quantization, and the
  untuned segment-length adjustment used before OCT/SPA pulse work.
- `spin_dynamics.optimization` provides the fixed SPA refocusing pulse catalog
  and MATLAB-style normalized SNR/FOM metric bookkeeping used by the
  `SPA_optimization_*` scripts. It also includes non-plotting tuned, untuned,
  and matched arbitrary-refocusing evaluators mirroring the
  `plot_masy_arbref_*` MATLAB helpers, plus array-returning SPA summary
  workflows for tuned, untuned, and matched probes. A lightweight discrete
  phase-program optimizer scaffold is available for small candidate searches.
  The ideal no-probe `v0crit`, excitation-aware `v0crit`, and
  time-varying-field refocusing objectives from
  `opt_ref_pulse_ideal_v0crit*.m` and `opt_ref_pulse_ideal_tv*.m` are available
  as array-returning evaluators, bounded phase optimizers, and multi-start
  drivers. The excitation-aware path includes the default ideal excitation
  vector preparation from `opt_ref_pulse_ideal_v0crit_exc_repeat.m`.
  Bounded refocusing phase optimizer wrappers are available around the existing
  tuned, untuned, and matched SNR evaluators; full MATLAB-equivalent OCT/SPA
  optimizer loops remain reference-only. Tuned excitation-pulse evaluation and
  bounded phase optimization are available for supplied refocusing axes.
  Array-returning multi-start driver scaffolds provide seeded repeated starts
  and best-result selection for the available refocusing, tuned excitation, and
  tuned inverse-excitation optimizers. The inverse driver starts from the
  phase-flipped target, then follows the MATLAB repeat workflow by perturbing
  the current best inverse pulse. The phase optimizers support an optional SciPy
  continuous bounded backend through the `opt` package extra, with a NumPy
  pattern-search fallback for minimal installations. Default phase bounds and
  random starts follow the MATLAB `0` to `2*pi` convention. Tuned
  inverse-excitation evaluation and bounded phase optimization are available
  for target received spectra, with compact MATLAB optimizer-result fixtures
  covering objective improvement. Strong inverse-cancellation workflows remain
  a validation target. A plotting-free pipeline helper now connects selected
  refocusing results to tuned excitation and inverse-excitation multi-start
  searches.
- MATLAB-style result-cell conversion, `.npz` archive load/export,
  script-aware `plot_opt_*_results.m` layout analysis, selected
  score/program/metadata inspection, tuned original/inverse result-pair
  comparison, and optional SciPy-backed `.mat` import/export are available for
  multi-start outputs. Keep broader real MATLAB optimizer-result fixture
  coverage, exact historical `params`/`sp`/`pp` file parity, and broad MATLAB
  `fmincon` result parity as later validation steps.

## Later Phase 9: Acceleration

- Start with NumPy/SciPy.
- Add Numba, Cython, compiled C/C++, or GPU backends only behind the same public
  API and only after baseline tests pass.
- Keep benchmarks small, repeatable, and independent of plotting.
